<h3>Powerplant quirks</h3>

<p>The Powerplant does not work as described in the manual. Due to a bug,
Asteros un-mined depletes at a rate of 1 per four days even if no
Powerplants are built. It produces 32Mw as long as there is at least one
un-mined Asteros, but cannot use mined ore from storage.</p>

<p>It produces no power without Asteros. Although the manual claims the
Powerplant produces 8MW/day, this appears to be a mis-reading of the
game code. The C.P.U. produces 8MW/day.</p>

<p>A random event can cause a Powerplant to explode, increasing a colony&#39;s
radiation. Strangely, Asteroid Engines also produce radiation if they
explode due to random event.</p>

<h3>Power failure</h3>

<p>If there is insufficient power to supply all buildings, they fail in a
specific order of preference.</p>

<h3>Air, food and water shortages</h3>

<p>Each colonist needs one unit of air, food and water per day. If production
is insufficient, the remaining colonists consume from stored surplus,
triggering &quot;resource deficiency&quot; and orange colour readout.</p>

<p>Red colour occurs when production is insufficient and there is no surplus,
leaving the remaining colonists with no air/food/water. Those colonists
without any food are killed at the following rate each day:</p>

<p>| Air   | Kills all affected colonists                     | 
| Food  | Kills 1/10 of affected colonists, plus one more  |
| Water | Kills 1/5 of affected colonists, plus one more   |</p>

<p>Additionally, for each resource in the red, social unrest increases by +2
points per day.</p>
