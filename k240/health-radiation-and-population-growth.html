<h3>Gaining and Losing Colonists</h3>

<p>Each colony has a 40% chance each day to gain a colonist. This is the
only way to gain workers. Population size does not affect growth rate.</p>

<p>Each colony has a 10% chance per day to lose one colonist. Colonists
can also be lost due to food/air/water shortages, untreated radiation,
virus outbreaks, certain alien bioweapons, desertion during civil unrest,
and sudden housing shortages caused by housing being blown up.</p>

<h3>Medical Centres</h3>

<p>If the colony has one Medical Centre for every 100 colonists after the
first 50, the outbreak ends. Otherwise, it loses two colonists per day.
Medical Centres can end virus outbreaks even if the building is without
power.</p>

<p>Each Medical Centre decreases the negative effects of radiation by 10%.</p>

<h3>Radiation</h3>

<p>Each asteroid has a certain amount of radiation. Radiation increases
by 10% for every 100 un-mined Asteros, and 10% for every 2 un-mined
Nexos.</p>

<p>Each Radiation Filter reduces radiation by 30%.</p>

<p>There is a percentage chance to lose a colonist each day, which
increases based on the amount of radiation not negated by Radiation Filters
or treated by Medical Centres.
Radiation | Chance of losing one colonist
----------|------------------------------
       0% |   1%
      10% |  11%
      20% |  12%
      30% |  14%
      40% |  15%
      50% |  18%
      60% |  21%
      70% |  26%
      80% |  34%
      90% |  51%
     100% | 100%</p>

<h3>Rapidly Declining Population</h3>

<p>The &quot;rapidly declining population&quot; warning triggers whenever a colony&#39;s
population drops to 30 or lower. If a reason is given (i.e. lack of food,
air or water), this means the colony is out of surplus in that resource and
may be losing colonists quickly.</p>

<p>If no reason is given, the most likely causes are radiation or certain
alien population-reducing weapons.</p>
