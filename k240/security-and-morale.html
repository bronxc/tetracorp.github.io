<p>A colony requires one Security Centre for every 100 colonists<br />
after the first 50, i.e. none for 0-149 colonists, one for<br />
150-249 colonists, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="rising-unrest">Rising Unrest</h3>
<p>Each day that a colony goes without sufficient Security Centres,<br />
it gains one point of Unrest, to a maximum of 310 points. Higher<br />
levels of Unrest lead to security events (see below).</p>

<p>After a security event, there is a random delay of 30 to 59 days<br />
before another security event can occur at that asteroid.</p>

<p>A colony with enough Security Centres reduces its Unrest by one<br />
point per day.</p>

<p>For each resource (air, food, water) that is currently unmet by<br />
either production or surplus, a colony gains 2 points of Unrest.</p>

<h3 id="unrest-levels">Unrest Levels</h3>
<p>| Points   | Status                   |<br />
|&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-|&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;|<br />
| 0-40     | ASTEROID SECURE.         |<br />
| 41-99    | LOW MORALE.              |<br />
| 100-199  | SOCIAL UNREST.           |<br />
| 200-299  | MAJOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. |<br />
| 300-310  | SECURITY ALERT!          |</p>

<h4 id="asteroid-secure">Asteroid Secure</h4>
<p>No security breach events happen.</p>

<h4 id="low-morale">Low Morale</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Worker strike (50% chance): All mining, shipbuilding, and missile<br />
construction are reduced to 40% of normal speed. Command Centre is<br />
also affected. (No other buildings require workers.) Strike lasts<br />
10-29 days.</li>
  <li>Theft (50% chance): 1,000 - 10,000 credits stolen. If there is not<br />
enough money in general fund to cover the loss, the rest is taken<br />
from Building fund, Vehicle fund, etc, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="social-unrest">Social Unrest</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Theft (33% chance): 10,000 - 50,000 credits stolen.</li>
  <li>Worker strike (33% chance): Workers strike for 30-99 days.</li>
  <li>Desertion (33% chance): If there are at least 50 colonists,<br />
5-14 disappear from the colony.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="major-criminal-activity">Major Criminal Activity</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Theft (25% chance): 50,000 - 100,000 credits stolen.</li>
  <li>Desertion (25% chance): 10-29 colonists disappear.</li>
  <li>Missile stolen (25% chance): All units of a random missile are<br />
deducted from silos. The missile is chosen at random (any except<br />
Anti-Virus), but if none of the chosen type are available it<br />
tries again with the next two missiles before giving up. Anti-Virus<br />
can therefore be stolen if the thieves attempt to steal Vortex when<br />
there are no Vortex. It may be useful to keep one of each cheap missile<br />
to guard against theft of valuable missiles that follow in the list,<br />
e.g. keep one Scatter, otherwise a failed Scatter theft attempt will<br />
lead you to lose Virus or Mega instead.</li>
  <li>Ship stolen (25% chance): One ship is lost. This will be an<br />
Assault Fighter if any are available, otherwise a Scout Ship.<br />
If no Scout Ships are available, no ship will be stolen.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="security-alert">Security Alert!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Theft (20% chance): 100,000 - 500,000 credits stolen.</li>
  <li>Desertion (20% chance): 10-29 colonists disappear.</li>
  <li>Ship stolen (20% chance): Randomly lose one of the following<br />
ships, in order of preference: Assault Fighter, Combat Eagle,<br />
Scout Ship, Transporter.</li>
  <li>Missile stolen (20% chance): Lose all units of a random missile.</li>
  <li>Blueprint stolen! (20% chance): A random blueprint is deleted.<br />
Missing blueprints can be re-purchased as normal from Sci-Tek,<br />
but the consequences can be disastrous.</li>
</ul>
