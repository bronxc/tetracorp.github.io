<p>While most buildings operate exactly as described in the game&#39;s manual,
some behave in undocumented or unexplained ways.</p>

<h3>Storage Facility / Storage Tower</h3>

<p>If an ore storage building is destroyed, no ore is lost unless the total
amount of ore stored at the asteroid now exceeds the total storage capacity.
When this happens, ore is lost starting with Selenium and going through the
ores in order until capacity is sufficient again.</p>

<h3>Anti-Missile Pod</h3>

<h3>Decontamination Filter</h3>

<p>Each Decontamination Filter decreases the radiation at a colony by 30%.</p>

<h3>Mine, Deep Bore Mine and Seismic Penetrator</h3>

<p>Each Mine recovers one ore per 4 days, or one per 2 days with the 2nd Generation
Mines blueprint. Each Deep Bore Mine recovers one every 16 days, or every 8
days with the 2nd Generation Deep Bore Mines blueprint.
Each Seismic penetrator recovers one ore every 16 days.</p>

<p>The ore mined is chosen at random from the types the mine is compatible with.
If there is none of that ore, the others are tried in order. For example, if
an asteroid has only Selenium and Asteros, 50% of the time it will attempt to
mine Barium or Crystalite and get Selenium instead. This effect applies only
to the Mine and Deep Bore Mine, but not the Seismic Penetrator, e.g. if there
is only Nexos but no Traxium, the Seismic Penetrator will recover Nexos 50%
of the time and do nothing the other 50%.</p>

<p>If there is not enough ore storage capacity at an asteroid, the ore will
not be mined. You cannot waste ore by building mines before storage. However,
due to a Powerplant bug, un-mined Asteros depletes automatically as if by
radioactive decay.</p>

<p>Each mine of any type requires eight colonists as workers. If there are
not enough workers, or the colony&#39;s workers are on strike, the mine operates
at 40% efficiency. Each time it would normally
recover an ore, it instead has a random 40% chance to succeed.
In event of a worker shortage, Mines are given precedence over Deep Bore Mines
and Seismic Penetrators.
If the mine is without power, it does not mine any ore.</p>

<h3>Screen Generator</h3>

<p>All buildings covered by at least one Screen Generator reduce all damage taken
by 50%. The Screen Generator benefits from its own protection.</p>

<h3>Gravity Nullifier</h3>

<p>In the event of a power outage, the Gravity Nullifier will switch off, but when
power returns, it does not automatically switch back on.</p>

<h3>Missile Silo</h3>

<p>Every 8 days, one of each missile type on order is built.</p>

<p>Each Missile Silo requires 8 colonists as workers. If there are not
enough workers or the colony&#39;s workers are on strike, missile construction
operates at 40% efficiency. Each day, there is only a 40% chance that
one missile will be built. Workers are not required to fire missiles.</p>

<h3>Repair Facility</h3>

<p>Each Repair Facility restores one point of damage to each building every eight
days, up to the building&#39;s normal maximum. Multiple facilities stack.</p>

<p>If the blueprint Building Armour is available, all buildings&#39; maximum hit points
are increased by 10. A Repair Facility will retroactively apply this bonus maximum
to buildings constructed before the Building Armour blueprint was purchased.</p>

<p>Small ships in hangars are repaired at the same rate of one point per Repair Facility
every eight days, to a maximum of the ship&#39;s base armour without shields. Contrary
to the manual, ships in orbit are never repaired, and ships in hangars only repair if
the colony has a Repair Facility.</p>

<h3>Laser, Plasma and Photon Turret</h3>

<p>Turrets have the following damage output:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Turret</th>
<th>Damage</th>
<th>With Optimizer</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Laser</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Plasma</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Photon</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>16</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The Turret Optimizer blueprint doubles the output. &quot;Protected&quot; buildings operate
exactly as a Laser Turret. Each Turret fires once every five days.</p>

<h3>Asteroid Engines</h3>

<p>A random event can cause Asteroid Engines to explode, increasing the colony&#39;s
radiation level.</p>

<p>Asteroid Engines require 2-7 power based on current speed (not 0-5 as
described in the manual).</p>

<h3>Powerplant</h3>

<p>Due to a bug, un-mined Asteros depletes at a rate of one unit per four days
even if no Powerplants have been built. As long as there is one unit of
Asteros left un-mined, every Powerplant produces 32MW of power. Multiple
Powerplants do not consume Asteros any more quickly, and they cannot use
mined Asteros from storage.</p>

<p>When Asteros is depleted, the Powerplant produces no power. Although the
manual states that it produces 8MW/day without Asteros, this appears to
be a misinterpretation of the game code, which produces 8MW/day per
C.P.U.</p>

<p>A random event can cause a Powerplant to explode, increasing a colony&#39;s
radiation level.</p>

<h3>Command Centre</h3>

<p>A Command Centre requires 8 colonists as workers.</p>

<h3>Construction Yard</h3>

<p>In order to make a day&#39;s progress toward a construction job, the yard requires
one day&#39;s worth of payment from Vehicle Fund. One of each ore is required per day
at the end of the ship&#39;s construction, e.g. the last two days of an Assault
Fighter&#39;s construction require one Selenium and Crystalite each. If all requirements
are met, the ship is reduced.</p>

<p>Each Construction Yard requires 8 colonists as workers. If there are not
enough workers or the colony&#39;s workers are on strike, all yards operate
at 40% efficiency. Each day, there is only a 40% chance that a day&#39;s
progress will be made.</p>

<p>There appears to he a maximum of 64 shipyards at any one time. Orbital Space
Docks and Command Centres (producing Orbital Space Docks) may count
toward this limit.</p>

<h3>Landing Pad</h3>

<p>Ships landed in hangars do not repair damage unless the colony also has a
Repair Facility.</p>

<h3>Medical Centre</h3>

<p>Each Medical Centre reduces the effects of radiation (but not the radiation
level itself) by 10%. In the event of a virus outbreak, a colony also
requires one Medical Centre for every 100 full colonists after the first 50
in order to end the outbreak.</p>

<p>See <a href="health-radiation-and-population-growth.html">Health, Radiation and Population Growth</a>.</p>

<h3>Security Centre</h3>

<p>A colony needs one Security Centre for every full 100 colonists after the
first 50 to prevent social unrest.
See <a href="security-and-morale.html">Security and Morale</a>.</p>

<h3>&quot;Protected&quot; buildings</h3>

<p>In addition to the laser turret attached to the
Protected Resiblock, Protected Solar Matrix, and Protected Environment Control,
these buildings have higher hit points than their non-protected counterparts
(see <a href="building-hitpoints.html">Building Hitpoints</a>). Protected Storage Tower does not.</p>
