### Power failure
If there is insufficient power to supply all buildings, they fail in a
specific order of preference, beginning with Asteroid Engines.

When Gravity Nullifier switches off due to a power outage, it does not
automatically switch itself back on when power is restored.

### Air, food and water shortages
Each colonist needs one unit of air, food and water per day. If production
is insufficient, the remaining colonists consume from stored surplus,
triggering "resource deficiency" and orange colour readout.

Red colour occurs when production is insufficient and there is no surplus,
leaving the remaining colonists with no air/food/water. Those colonists
without any food are killed at the following rate each day:

| Resource | Affected colonists killed per day           |
|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Air      | Kills all affected colonists                | 
| Food     | Kills 1/10 of affected colonists, plus one  |
| Water    | Kills 1/5 of affected colonists, plus one   |

Additionally, for each resource in the red, social unrest increases by +2
points per day.
