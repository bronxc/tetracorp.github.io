The _Tetracorp_ project seeks to uncover the mysteries of classic video games
and to preserve their legacy by documenting their existence. The project's
activities include disassembling games.

An overview of some of the most interesting findings appears below.

- [K240](../k240/) (Amiga, 1994) has the most in-depth investigation into its
  numerous undocumented game mechanics, including:
  - An undocumented feature gives you 100 credits per day per colony, and 2
    credits per day per colonist.
  - Exact hit points and damage values have been discovered for all Terran and
    alien buildings, ships, and nearly all ship hardpoints.
  - Exact mechanics have been discovered for random events, most buildings,
    social unrest, and resource deficiency.
  - You can skip the intro by holding the left mouse button.
  - Building discovered to be incorrectly documented in the manual include the
    Powerplant (generates no power without Asteros) and Repair Facility (only
    repairs ships in hangar, never repairs large ships).
- [Dungeons of Avalon](../dungeons-of-avalon/) (Amiga, 1992) has an interesting
  release history involving two simultaneous official and bootleg English
  versions. Complete maps have been extracted for both games. DoA1 has been
  proven to be unwinnable, but the game win screen is functional, and can be
  triggered with a memory editor. Unused content has been found, including Gnom
  Bones of the NPC Hanibal (class: Murderer), while the NPCs Clint and Beard are
  found to have the classes Pirate and Bard, respectively. An early alpha
  version of the game is analyzed for differences. New, more accurate
  translations have been made of the original German text.
- [Tokimeki Memorial](../tokimeki-memorial/) (PSX, 1994) accidentally left a
  file containing debug data in the original release.
- In [Match Patch](../amiga/matchpatch.html) (Amiga, 1990), two cheats have been
  discovered: holding left before pressing Fire at the title screen skips to
  level 10, while holding right reduces the threshold for gaining a new life
  from 20,000 points to 10,000.

Some information has also been collected at the various sub-projects regarding
analysis methods.
